@article{Hedeker2008,
abstract = {For longitudinal data, mixed models include random subject effects to indicate how subjects influence their responses over repeated assessments. The error variance and the variance of the random effects are usually considered to be homogeneous. These variance terms characterize the within-subjects (i.e., error variance) and between-subjects (i.e., random-effects variance) variation in the data. In studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), up to 30 or 40 observations are often obtained for each subject, and interest frequently centers around changes in the variances, both within and between subjects. In this article, we focus on an adolescent smoking study using EMA where interest is on characterizing changes in mood variation. We describe how covariates can influence the mood variances, and also extend the standard mixed model by adding a subject-level random effect to the within-subject variance specification. This permits subjects to have influence on the mean, or location, and variability, or (square of the) scale, of their mood responses. Additionally, we allow the location and scale random effects to be correlated. These mixed-effects location scale models have useful applications in many research areas where interest centers on the joint modeling of the mean and variance structure.},

@article{OHara2009,
abstract = {The selection of variables in regression problems has occupied the minds of many statisticians. Several Bayesian variable selection methods have been developed, and we concentrate on the following methods: Kuo {\&} Mallick, Gibbs Variable Selection (GVS), Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), adaptive shrinkage with Je{\AE}reys' prior or a Laplacian prior, and reversible jump MCMC. We review these methods, in the context of their di{\AE}erent properties. We then implement the methods in BUGS, using both real and simulated data as examples, and investigate how the di{\AE}erent methods perform in practice. Our results suggest that SSVS, reversible jump MCMC and adaptive shrinkage methods can all work well, but the choice of which method is better will depend on the priors that are used, and also on how they are implemented.},
