Description: Bayesian hypothesis testing of mean and variance relations in mixed effects location scale models. 
  There are hypothesis tests for correlations in the distribution of random effects, as well as 
  Bayesian model averaging and selection. This is accomplished with mixture prior distributions or 
  spike and slab methodology. There are plotting capabilities for the individual difference 
  parameters (random effects).
